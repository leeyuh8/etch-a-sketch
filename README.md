# Etch-a-Sketch

## PURPOSE:
To create an interactive Etch-a-Sketch where the user draws by hovering their mouse.
[Live Demo](https://leeyuh8.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/)

## SKILLS:
- DOM manipulation and events through javascript to add dynamic styling and interactive components.
- Use string and array methods.
- Writing functions.

## LESSONS LEARNED:
- Use element.div.style.<css-property> to add/change inline 
styles on an element without affecting any other inline styles. 
Using element.setAttribute() will replace the previous inline styles.
- Use "git reset --hard <commit code>" to unstage files and reset to last commit.
- Variables accessed by multiple functions need to be declared
in global scope.
